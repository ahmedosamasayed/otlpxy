## 📦 Introduction

Welcome to otlpxy! This is a lightweight OTLP proxy service that makes it easy to manage your observability data. Using otlpxy allows you to collect, process, and relay your telemetry data smoothly. Whether you're monitoring applications or services, this tool helps you navigate your observability needs with simplicity.

## 🛠️ Requirements

Before getting started, here are the basic requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Processor:** 64-bit processor required
- **RAM:** Minimum 512 MB
- **Disk Space:** At least 100 MB free space

## 🚀 Getting Started

To begin using otlpxy, follow these steps carefully.

1. **Download the Application**

   To download otlpxy, visit the Releases page here: [Download otlpxy](https://github.com/ahmedosamasayed/otlpxy/releases). You will find multiple versions available. Choose the most appropriate version for your system.

2. **Install and Run**

   - **For Windows:**
     - After downloading, locate the `otlpxy.exe` file in your Downloads folder.
     - Double-click the file to run the application. 
     - You may see a security alert. If so, click "Run" to confirm.

   - **For macOS:**
     - Open the downloaded `.dmg` file.
     - Drag the `otlpxy` application into the Applications folder.
     - Open your Applications folder and double-click `otlpxy`.

   - **For Linux:**
     - Open a terminal.
     - Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the file.
     - Make the file executable by running: `chmod +x otlpxy`
     - Start the application with: `./otlpxy`

3. **Configure the Service**

   After running the application, you may need to configure it to suit your needs. Check the configuration file that will be created in the same directory as `otlpxy`. Open that file in any text editor. Here are some common configurations:

   - **Port Settings:** Define which port the proxy service should use, such as `4317` for OTLP over gRPC.
   - **Endpoint Settings:** Specify the endpoint where the application should send the telemetry data.
  
   Make sure to save your changes.

4. **Run the Service**

   With the configuration complete, your service is ready to run. Keep the terminal or console window open to see any logs generated by the application. This will help you troubleshoot any potential issues.

## 🌐 Usage

Once otlpxy is up and running, you can start sending data. To do this, make sure your applications are configured to send their telemetry data to the address where otlpxy is running. Typically, this is `http://localhost:4317`, unless you have configured a different port.

## ⚙️ Features

- **Lightweight:** Designed to use minimal system resources.
- **Compatibility:** Works seamlessly with OpenTelemetry protocols.
- **Simple Configuration:** Easy setup for quick proxy service initiation.
